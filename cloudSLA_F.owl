  <hasStandards>A “Service Credit” is a dollar credit, calculated as set forth above, that we may credit back to an eligible account.


“Availability Zone” and “AZ” mean an isolated location within an AWS region identified by a letter identifier following the AWS region code (e.g., us-west-1a).


“Hourly Uptime Percentage” is calculated by subtracting from 100% the percentage of deployed minutes during any clock hour in which a Single EC2 Instance was in a state of Unavailability. Hourly Uptime Percentage measurements exclude Unavailability resulting directly or indirectly from any Amazon Compute SLA Exclusion


“Monthly Uptime Percentage” is calculated by subtracting from 100% the percentage of minutes during the month in which any of the Included Services, as applicable, was in the state of Unavailability. Monthly Uptime Percentage measurements exclude Unavailability resulting directly or indirectly from any Amazon Compute SLA Exclusion.


“Unavailable” and “Unavailability” mean:

o For Single EC2 Instances, when your Single EC2 Instance has no external connectivity.
o For Amazon EC2 (other than Single EC2 Instances), Amazon ECS, or Amazon Fargate, when all of your running instances or running tasks, as applicable, deployed in two or more AZs in the same AWS region (or, if there is only one AZ in the AWS region, that AZ and an AZ in another AWS region) concurrently have no external connectivity.
o For Amazon EBS, when all of your attached volumes deployed in two or more AZs in the same AWS region (or, if there is only one AZ in the AWS region, that AZ and an AZ in another AWS region) perform zero read write IO, with pending IO in the queue.</hasStandards>

  <hasStandards rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">"Availability Set" refers to two or more Virtual Machines deployed across different Fault Domains to avoid a single point of failure.

"Availability Zone” is a fault-isolated area within an Azure region, providing redundant power, cooling, and networking.

"Azure Dedicated Host" provides physical servers that host one or more Azure virtual machines with the (default) setting of autoReplaceOnFailure required for any SLA.

"Data Disk" is a persistent virtual hard disk, attached to a Virtual Machine, used to store application data.

"Dedicated Host Group" is a collection of Azure Dedicated Hosts deployed within an Azure region across different Fault Domains to avoid a single point of failure.

"Fault Domain" is a collection of servers that share common resources such as power and network connectivity.

"Operating System Disk" is a persistent virtual hard disk, attached to a Virtual Machine, used to store the Virtual Machine’s operating system.

"Single Instance" is defined as any single Microsoft Azure Virtual Machine that either is not deployed in an Availability Set or has only one instance deployed in an Availability Set.

"Virtual Machine" refers to persistent instance types that can be deployed individually, as part of an Availability Set or using a Dedicated Host Group. A virtual machine can be deployed in a multi-tenant environment in Azure or in an isolated, single-tenant environment using Azure Dedicated Hosts.

"Virtual Machine Connectivity" is bi-directional network traffic between the Virtual Machine and other IP addresses using TCP or UDP network protocols in which the Virtual Machine is configured for allowed traffic. The IP addresses can be IP addresses in the same Cloud Service as the Virtual Machine, IP addresses within the same virtual network as the Virtual Machine or public, routable IP addresses.

Monthly Uptime Calculation and Service Levels for Virtual Machines in Availability Zones
"Maximum Available Minutes" is the total accumulated minutes during a billing month that have two or more instances deployed across two or more Availability Zones in the same region. Maximum Available Minutes is measured from when at least two Virtual Machines across two Availability Zones in the same region have both been started resultant from action initiated by Customer to the time Customer has initiated an action that would result in stopping or deleting the Virtual Machines.

"Downtime" is the total accumulated minutes that are part of Maximum Available Minutes that have no Virtual Machine Connectivity in the region.

"Monthly Uptime Percentage" for Virtual Machines in Availability Zones is calculated as Maximum Available Minutes less Downtime divided by Maximum Available Minutes in a billing month for a given Microsoft Azure subscription. Monthly Uptime Percentage is represented by the following formula:

Monthly Uptime % = (Maximum Available Minutes – Downtime) / Maximum Available Minutes X 100

"Maximum Available Minutes" is the total accumulated minutes during a billing month for all Virtual Machines that have two or more instances deployed in the same Availability Set, or in the same Dedicated Host Group. Maximum Available Minutes is measured from when at least two Virtual Machines in the same Availability Set, or same Dedicated Host Group, have both been started resultant from action initiated by Customer to the time Customer has initiated an action that would result in stopping or deleting the Virtual Machines.

"Downtime" is the total accumulated minutes that are part of Maximum Available Minutes that have no Virtual Machine Connectivity.

"Monthly Uptime Percentage" for Virtual Machines is calculated as Maximum Available Minutes less Downtime divided by Maximum Available Minutes in a billing month for a given Microsoft Azure subscription. Monthly Uptime Percentage is represented by the following formula:

Monthly Uptime % = (Maximum Available Minutes-Downtime) / Maximum Available Minutes X 100

Monthly Uptime Calculation and Service Levels for Single-Instance Virtual Machines
"Minutes in the Month" is the total number of minutes in a given month.

"Downtime" is the total accumulated minutes that are part of Minutes in the Month that have no Virtual Machine Connectivity.

"Monthly Uptime Percentage" is calculated by the percentage of Minutes in the Month in which any Single Instance Virtual Machine using Premium SSD or Ultra Disk for all Operating System Disks and Data Disks had Downtime.

Monthly Uptime % = (Minutes in the Month - Downtime) / Minutes in the Month X 100</hasStandards>

Instances hosted as part of the Google Compute Engine Service.
Load balancing as part of the Google Compute Engine Service.
“Downtime” means:

For virtual machine instances: Loss of external connectivity or persistent disk access for all running Instances, when Instances are placed across two or more Zones in the same Region.
For load balancing: Loss of external connectivity (via the external IP addresses associated with load balancing forwarding rules with all Healthy Backend Instances) due to the failure of Google’s systems.

Downtime does not include loss of external connectivity as a result of (i) the Google managed VPN service failing to serve traffic directed to VPN tunnels under that service; that sort of downtime is addressed exclusively in the VPN SLA; or (ii) Network Service Tiers - Standard Tier failing to serve traffic.
“Monthly Uptime Percentage” means total number of minutes in a month, minus the number of minutes of Downtime suffered from all Downtime Periods in a month, divided by the total number of minutes in a month.

“Healthy Backend Instances” means Instances that are responding affirmatively to load balancing health checks.
“Downtime Period” means a period of one or more consecutive minutes of Downtime. Partial minutes or Intermittent Downtime for a period of less than one minute will not be counted towards any Downtime Periods.

“Region” means the applicable region described at https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/regions-zones/, as may be updated by Google from time to time.

“Zone” means the applicable zone described at https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/regions-zones/, as may be updated by Google from time to time.
